# My First Flask Project
I'm trying to build a simple web application using Flask. I'm following freeCodeCamp's tutorial on making a simple "Task Master" application using Flask.

## HOWTO:question:
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the repo
3. **Create a virtual environment**:`python3 -m virtualenv ./venv` or `virtualenv ./venv` (I forgot the exact command :sweatsmile:)
4. **Activate your virtual environment**: On Windows:
    - `cmd` (your VS Code should by default open a Powershell terminal) and then `call ./venv/Scripts/activate.bat`

   On Linux: I forgot, folks (:cry:) 
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run either `python app.py` or `flask run` to run your webapp, open `https://localhost:5000/` on your web browser
## TODO:white_check_mark:
1. Deploy on Vercel (:cross: - I have to)
2. Do more Flask stuff :) (:cross: - not yet started lol)
